first----
	Do scf calculation
2-----
	do n-scf calulation to obtain band structure
3-----
	Extract the energies from the non‚ÄêSCF calculation and convert it
	to a dataset we can plot with Gnuplot or Python
	if we want to do this manually(other than run.sh) in terminal
	we have to use band.x(given in photo)
